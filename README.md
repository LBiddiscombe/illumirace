# sveltekit-partykit-starter

A really simple multiplayer game that uses PartyKit.

## The "Game"
Create a new game room, and share the code with friends, or join with a code shared with you.

The "game" is simple - you'll be shown 1, 4, 9 or 16 labelled buttons in a grid.

They are in a random order.

Click them in sequence starting at 1.

Fastest to click them all wins!
